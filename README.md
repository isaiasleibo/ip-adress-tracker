# IP Address Tracker App

This project is a solution to the challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).

The goal was to build a web application that allows users to track the location and details of an IP address or domain name. The project used the IP Geolocation API provided by [IPWhois](https://ipwhois.io/) to get the location details and ReactJS to generate the map.

## Project Requirements

The requirements for the project were to:

- Build a web application that displays the location of an IP address or domain name on a map.
- Use the IP Geolocation API provided by IPWhois to get the location details.
- Use ReactJS to generate the map.
- Use Sass for styling.
- Ensure that the application is responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.
- Allow users to search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.

## Technology Used

The following technologies were used to complete the project:

- HTML
- Sass
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- LeafletJS
- IPWhois API

## Solution Overview

The solution consists of React components, a Sass stylesheet, and a JavaScript file. The React components contain the structure of the application and the necessary elements for rendering the map. The Sass stylesheet provides the styles for the HTML elements, and the JavaScript file handles the API requests, map rendering, and search functionality.

To ensure that the application is responsive, the design was implemented using a mobile-first approach, and media queries were used to adjust the layout for larger screen sizes.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
